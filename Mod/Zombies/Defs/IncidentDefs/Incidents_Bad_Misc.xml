    <letterLabel>Zombie Virus is airborne</letterLabel>
    <letterText>We've received an urgent message from a nearby town.\n\nThere has been a zombie outbreak in several of the neighboring towns! According to experts the virus is now airborne and we could already be infected!\n\nIf this is true, all human corpses could soon start reanimating. Maybe we should start burning them.</letterText>
